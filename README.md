# Setting environment variables
To configure environment variables in your project, you can create an .env file in your project root and define the variables you want to use, in the following format:

```bash
# API configuration
API_PORT = 80  # The port number for the API.
API_DNS = "http://localhost:3214"  # The DNS address for the API.

HYGRAPH_URL = ""  # The URL for the Hygraph service.
MEMBER_STACK_API_KEY = ""  # The API key for the Member Stack service.

# Lndhub configuration
LNDHUB_URL = "https://ln.getalby.com"  # The URL for the Lndhub service.
LNDHUB_USERNAME = ""  # The username for the Lndhub service.
LNDHUB_PASSWORD = ""  # The password for the Lndhub service.
```

### Configuring Lightning Wallet
To configure the Lightning wallet that will serve as a wallet for the distribution of prizes, follow the tutorial at: https://blog.getalby.com/bluewallet-alby-how-to-switch-lndhub/. When you get a URL that looks a lot like the following, you'll need to split the URL into two pieces of random digits and assign them to the `LNDHUB_USERNAME` and `LNDHUB_PASSWORD` environment variables, respectively. Once this is done, you are ready to proceed.

```bash
# Lndhub configuration
LNDHUB_URL = "https://ln.getalby.com"  # The URL for the Lndhub service.
LNDHUB_USERNAME = "9be40f1c4119c683"  # The username for the Lndhub service.
LNDHUB_PASSWORD = "f5faf044b2cc25d2"  # The password for the Lndhub service.
```

## Launching the application with Docker.

Here's how to run the app using `docker-compose.yml` without needing to configure Redis and Kafka:
